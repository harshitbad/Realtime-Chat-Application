# Realtime-Chat-Application
This is basic chat application in which I used HTML , CSS and JavaScript as frontend part. Also I used Node.js for server purpose and also used Socket.io programming.In that application many users can chat with eachother. Also It used socket.io callbacks and events to handle the incoming and outgoing messages.
